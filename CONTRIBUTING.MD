I'm making this because the issue reports have gotten a bit ridiculous at this point. 

1. Do NOT post your error in the issue directly, please use http://gist.github.com/ or http://pastebin.com/
2. Do NOT post the entire description of your error in the title, the title is just a very short explanation.
3. DO post information about the crash you were able to discover in the actual issue text.
4. DO see if the issue occurs with just AS+ and MovingWorld installed, so I know if it's an incompatibility issue.
5. For any report at all you must list the AS+ version, the MovingWorld version, the Forge version, and the Minecraft version. If this is not done the issue will be closed.

Here's a basic do and don't.

Title: Mod incompatibility with Mod X

I'm experiencing a crash when I do x in scenario y, it's not consistent though as it only happens sometimes.

Here's my crash log: https://gist.github.com/darkevilmac/1a6bea48cb215ea8fa464bf01a4d28ff
